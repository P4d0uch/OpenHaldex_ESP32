OpenHaldex controler can be used to gain control over the Haldex
This is a modified version of the great work by ABangingDonk https://github.com/ABangingDonk/OpenHaldexT4 and AdamForbes92 https://github.com/adamforbes92/OpenHaldex-C6

This version uses ESP32 dev kit V4 and two MCP2515 transcievers becouse my version of ESP does not have two native CAN interfaces
